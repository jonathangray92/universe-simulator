Universe Simulator
==================

Simulation of the gravitational attraction and motion of "stars" in a 2d universe.

This whole project is really an excuse to try out some neat algorithms and build some fun stuff from scratch.

Until I find the time to write a humongous, detailed readme: there are docstrings a-plenty in these files, and they should give an idea of what everything does.
